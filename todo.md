# Telescope

- enable sending selection / all from a telescope into quick fix list, see
https://github.com/kitagry/dotfiles/blob/4fe3af3288d40f296a782971080b7b8cb43a36d5/.config/nvim/lua/kitagry/telescope.lua
  - look into other `telescope.actions` - there may be additional gems hiding
- lr -> list registers doesn't work, there's an error message

# General

- "center toggle" (t-) does not work (generally, `scrolloff)
- colors are ugly as hell

# Plugins

- potential replacement for gitgutter: [gitsigns.nvim](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim)
